--Tell me about check constraints: What are they? What are they good for? What’s the advantage of putting that sort of thing inside the database? Make up some examples of good uses of check constraints and some examples of bad uses of check constraints. Explain the differences in your examples and argue your case.

/*

A check constraint is a constraint placed on a datatype when creating a table. For
example, if you create a table with a primary key, you don’t want the primary key 
to be zero or a negative integer, so you would add a check constraint so the primary 
key is greater than zero. This is good because it can make the data more precise and
accurate making the database better. The advantages of putting check constraints in is
it helps with making the database less prone to user errors. For example, in the last
example if the user meant to put 10 as the ID but only put 0, the check constraint would
display an error. A good example of a check constraint is discount >=0 && discount <100.
A bad example would be discount >=0. The difference between the two is that in the good
example there are limits on either side of what the discount can be (the discount should not be more that 100%), where as in the bad example the discount could be more than 100% which is not a real life scenario in business.
